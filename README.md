# One-step-closer

Requirements for this tutorial:
- Download Git
- Notepad ++ 

Every task must have it's own branch. You are not allowed to commit anything to master nor change master in any way or shape unless it's through a pull request signed and approved by me.(Sebastian)

Every day since you take a certain task must have at least one significant commit to show your improvements. 

If any of the rules above are not respected I will cease to provide instructions or task for this tutorial.

In order to learn how git works there is a special guide you can follow before you take on any task.

Go to nodeschool.io and follow the instructions provided in the git-it workshopper. 

That should give you a basic understanding of Master/Branch, Push/Pull, Commit, conflicts
